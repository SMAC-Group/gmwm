\title{Removal of Boundary Wavelet Coefficients}
\usage{
brick_wall(x, wave_filter, method = "modwt")
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{field<vec>} that contains the nlevel decomposition using either modwt or dwt.}

\item{wave_filter}{A \code{field<vec>} containing filter information.}

\item{method}{A \code{string} to describe the mode.}
}
\value{
A \code{field<vec>} with boundary modwt or dwt taken care of.
}
\description{
Removes the first n wavelet coefficients.
}
\details{
The vectors are truncated by removing the first n wavelet coefficients.
These vectors are then stored into the field that is returned.
Note: As a result, there are no NA's introduced and hence the na.omit is not needed.
}
\examples{
x=rnorm(100)
brick_wall(modwt_cpp(x))
